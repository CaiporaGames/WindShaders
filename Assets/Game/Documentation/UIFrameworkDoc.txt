Here I explain how to work with the UI Framework system.

Its porpose is to controll the UI flow allowing we to open and close screen in a simple way.


Workflow:
- In the GameFlowManager script we create a reference to the UI controller we need.
    Ex: [SerializeField] private AuthScreenController _authScreenController;
- In the Start method we register each screen controller.
    Ex: _uiService.Register(ScreenTypes.MessageScreen, _messageScreenController);

OBS.: We first need to create a screen type.

- IUIService, we need to implement this to call the ShowScreenAsync and HideScreenAsync. We call them like:
    await ServiceLocator.Resolve<IUIService>().ShowScreenAsync<object>(ScreenTypes.DashboardScreen);

OBS 1.: We can pass the screen that should keep opened in the second parameter.
OBS 2.: We can pass extra data as third parameter.

This way can controll the flow of what should be open or closed and pass extra information from one 
screen to another.

- Controllers. Each controller is a concreate class from BaseUIController, this class have 3 important 
methods we can override. 
 + InitializeAsync: Used as a start method.
 + ShowAsync: Used to show some type of extra information or initialization in the screen.
 + HideAsync: Used to do extra clean up.
