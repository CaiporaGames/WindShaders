Here I explain how to work with the dependency Injection (DI) system.

Its propose it to be a simple way to have access to singletons in the whole project.

Workflow:
We can register them in any point of the development doing like this:
 ServiceLocator.RegisterSingleton<ISaveService>(_saveService);

and we can use them like this:
    var ui = ServiceLocator.Resolve<IUIService>();

OBS.: We register the interface so we can have a Dependency Inversion too in the project.

Now we can use the service in any place of the project.
